extends Area3D

## A reusable volume that activates its PhantomCamera3D while the player is
## inside.
##
## Follow / look behaviour is driven entirely by the PhantomCamera3D's own
## configured [member PhantomCamera3D.follow_mode] and
## [member PhantomCamera3D.look_at_mode]:
## - If follow_mode is not NONE, the camera follows PhantomCameraTarget3D, which
##   this script keeps at the player's position.
## - If look_at_mode is not NONE, the camera looks at PhantomCameraTarget3D.
## - If neither is configured, the camera is static and uses its authored
##   transform in the scene.
##
## Report a single body that can trigger this volume. The player body is
## matched via the "player" group.
